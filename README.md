## Answer Sketches and Grading Rubrics

As each Lab passes its deadline (as listed in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html)), we will move it here, and add information on how you can obtain the answer sketch (usually available within 24 hours of the deadline), as well as grades and the grading rubric (usually available one week after the deadline.)

## Late Policy (No extensions)

- Note that your lowest lab score (out of Labs 1-7) over the course of the semester will be dropped before we calculate your lab grade.
- To receive full credit on a Lab, it must be received on Canvas no later than 59 minutes after the posted deadline. (This allows for small issues with uploading to Canvas to occur without penalty.)
- Labs that are turned in 1-12 hours after the deadline will lose 10% of available points.
- Labs turned in more than 12 but less than 72 hours after the deadline will lose 25% of available points.
- No extensions to Lab deadlines will be permitted this semester. Labs turned in more than 72 hours after the deadline will receive no credit.

## An Important Note

Your response to **every** question, whether we explicitly ask for it or not, should include a complete English sentence responding to the question. Code alone is not a sufficient response, even if the code is correct. Some responses might not need any code, but every response needs at least one complete sentence.

## Submitting Your Work

Each set of Lab instructions provides details on how to submit your work. Mostly, this is done through the Assignments folder in [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), but check the instructions.

## Getting Help

You are welcome to discuss Lab 01 with Professor Love, the teaching assistants or your colleagues, but your answer must be prepared by you alone. Don't be afraid to ask questions, using any of the methods described on our [Contact Us](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/contact.html) page.
